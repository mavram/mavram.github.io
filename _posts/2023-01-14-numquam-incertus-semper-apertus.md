The best single advice is a motto I read on the ceiling of a German drinking fraternity in Heidelberg. This cave had been there, I guess, since the 16th century. It said, Numquam incertus; semper apertus: "Never uncertain, always open." Sometimes the first part is put as saying, "You can't steer a ship that's not underway." At any given time, you ought to have pretty clear goals, and know where you're going, and be going there. On the other hand, you always should be open to saying, "Is that what we really ought to be doing? Here's another idea." But sitting still in the water waiting to decide which way to go is the wrong thing to do.
