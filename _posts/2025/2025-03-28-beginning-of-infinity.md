You don't need to know and memorize every fact. If you understand the deep underlying theories behind everything then you know at a higher level how everything works. This can all be understood by a single person. It's accessible to anybody. We can have explanations that can reach the entire universe from four theories: Quantum Theory, Theory of Computation, Theory of Evolution, and Theory of Knowledge.
