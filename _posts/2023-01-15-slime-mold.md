* 0.95^10 = 0.60; thanks to non-linearity, even small decline in individual likelihood leads to a much lower overall decline in likelihood of success.
* Don’t hold yourself to an impossible standard, but take responsibility for the choices you make.
* Look for a way to decouple things as much as possible. Instead of having everything perfect today, aim for eventual convergence.
* The better model sights for the moon, and picks a no-brainer roofshot step that will bring you closer. Once you ‘ve done the roofshot, you’ve locked in that step value, and have gained momentum for the next step. Keep repeating! You will waste effort, but you will do it in a safe way that continuously unlocks more value. The pattern gets more powerful with multiple teams. If they are all sighting the same moon , over time they will naturally converge. This renders an ideal pattern of loosely coupled, tightly aligned.
