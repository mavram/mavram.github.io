                Hi! I’m Mircea (<em>MEER-cha / IPA: mirt͡ʃe̯a </em>). I’m a dad, husband, and inqusitive mind.
                I'm originally from
                <a class="no-hover-decoration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re%C8%99i%C8%9Ba">Resita</a>,
                Romania and found my home in
                <a class="no-hover-decoration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaside">Leaside</a>,
                Toronto, Canada.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                My work is all things technology releated: senior leadership, product development,
                technology strategy and transformation, architecture, data science and software engineering.
                If you want to find more about my current and past experience see

                Needless to say none of the opinions expressed in any of these pages are related with my

                Every day I try to find some time to
                <a class="no-hover-decoration" href="https://www.amazon.com/Search-Memory-Emergence-Science-Mind/dp/0393329372/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">read</a>
                , move around, learn something new, play a
                <a class="no-hover-decoration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)">game</a>,
                listen to a 
                <a class="no-hover-decoration" href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/writersandcompany">podcast</a> or

                or simply enjoy.
                Seldom do I manage to do all of these in one day but I've mastered aiming high and missing.

                I do not offer advice. The only thing close to one that I have is: do not read
                too much into any of the things you read here. I'm just a fellow traveler.
                You can find me on 
                <a class="no-hover-decoration" href="https://github.com/mavram">GitHub<a>
                or send me an <a class="no-hover-decoration" href="mailto:mavram@gmail.com">email</a>.
                Cheers!
