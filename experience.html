                I had the opportunity to work with <strong>amazing teams</strong> and solve many
                <strong>interesting problems</strong>.
                Whether it was to develop a <strong>kernel mode device driver</strong> to allow snapshoting of a running operating system
                image with zero downtime,
                build a <strong>distributed MPI service</strong>
                handling high-volume of TPS with low-latency performance charateristics,
                build a <strong>provisioning &amp; automation product</strong> to manage thousands of servers and devices in a datacenter,
                drive the <strong>re-engineering effort</strong> for the end-to-end SDLC process in a global capital markets technology group,
                lead the creation of the <strong>target operating model</strong> for a global capital markets architecture group,
                be one of the <strong>principal engineers</strong> in shaping and driving the <strong>innovation &amp; digital transformation</strong> for a global bank technology &amp; operations group,
                be the <strong>head of engineering</strong> building a
                <strong>data analytics platform</strong> and the engineering group to support it,
                at heart I was, am, and will be always motivated by the <strong>opportunity to learn</strong> new things and
                <strong>make a difference</strong> for the people I'm working with.
                While my career progressed to more <strong>leadership</strong> roles I've made an effort to stay <strong>hands-on</strong>.
                I'm equally able to create the materials for a strategic initiative and present to senior executives,
                lead a large software engineering group, or solve a challenging technical problem.
