                I’ve worked with exceptional teams to tackle diverse, challenging problems.
                Throughout my career I developed kernel-mode device drivers, built a distributed MPI service for low-latency transactions, built automation tools to manage thousands of data center servers and devices, led the re-engineering of SDLC processes for a global capital markets technology group, and defined the operating model for a global architecture team.
                As a principal engineer, I drove innovation and digital transformation in a global bank’s technology and operations group, and as head of engineering, I built a data analytics platform and its engineering team.
                In my current role, I lead a group of teams responsible for delivering and operating worldwide core capabilities for Amazon Fulfillment Technologies and Robotics.

                My drive? A love for learning and impactful collaboration.
                Though I’ve moved into leadership, I stay hands-on and am equally adept at crafting strategies for executives, leading large teams, or solving tough technical issues.
                This mix lets me deliver, whether the task demands vision, leadership, or expertise.
