                I have had the privilege of working with exceptional teams to solve a diverse range of interesting problems.
                My journey has taken me through opportunities to develop a kernel-mode device driver that enabled live snapshotting of
                operating system images with zero downtime and to build a distributed MPI service capable of handling high transaction
                volumes with low-latency performance. I’ve designed and implemented provisioning and automation products to manage
                thousands of servers and devices in data centers, driven the re-engineering of end-to-end SDLC processes for a global
                capital markets technology group, and shaped the target operating model for a global capital markets architecture team.

                As a principal engineer, I contributed to innovation and digital transformation within a global bank’s technology and
                operations group, and later, as the head of engineering, I led the creation of a data analytics platform and the team
                to support it. Through all of this, my core motivation has remained the same: a passion for learning and making a meaningful
                difference for the people I work with.

                While my career has progressed into leadership roles, I have made a deliberate effort to stay hands-on. I am just as capable
                of crafting strategic materials and presenting them to senior executives as I am of leading large engineering teams or solving
                complex technical problems. This balance has allowed me to contribute effectively, whether the challenge required strategic
                vision, team leadership, or technical expertise.
